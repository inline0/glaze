# Selectors

By default, Glaze searches for elements with the `data-animate` attribute and builds the animation based on the value of that attribute. You can change this behavior.

## Custom attribute

Use a different data attribute:

```js
glaze({
  lib: { gsap: { core: gsap } },
  dataAttribute: "data-move",
});
```

Now Glaze will look for `data-move` instead of `data-animate`:

```html
<div data-move="from:opacity-0"></div>
```

## Class-based syntax

Prefer classes over data attributes? Enable class mode:

```js
glaze({
  lib: { gsap: { core: gsap } },
  className: "animate",
});
```

Now you can write animations as classes:

```html
<div class="animate-from:opacity-0|duration-1"></div>
```

This works well if you're already using utility-first CSS and want your animations to feel similar.
